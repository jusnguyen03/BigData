# BigData

## Project Overview
I will be diving into what constitutes big data and how it's handled. I will be:
  - Define big data and describe the challenges associate with it.
  - Define Hadoop and name the main elements of its ecosystem.
  - Explain how MapReduce processes data.
  - Define Spark and explain how it processes data.
  - Describe how NLP collects and analyzes text data.
  - Explain how to use AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and relational databases for basic cloud storage.
  - Complete an analysis of an Amazon customer review.

## Resources
- Data Source: https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz , user_data.csv, user_payment.csv
- Software: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Colab Notebooks, pgAdmin 4, RDS

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will perform the ETL process completely in the cloud and upload a DataFrame to an RDS instance. Then I will use PySpark to perform a statistical analysis of the selected data.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Perform ETL on one of the review datasets.
  2. Store your results on an AWS RDS database.
  3. Determine if reviews are biased using PySpark or SQL with the appropriate statistical methods.
